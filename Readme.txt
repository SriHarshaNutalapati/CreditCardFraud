Please download dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud.

Although digital transactions in India registered a 51% growth in 2018â€“2019, their safety remains a concern. Fraudulent activities have increased severalfold, with approximately 52,304 cases of credit/debit card fraud reported in FY 2019 alone. Owing to this steep increase in banking frauds, it is the need of the hour to detect these fraudulent transactions in time to help consumers and banks that are losing their credit worth each day. Machine learning can play a vital role in detecting fraudulent transactions.

In this notebook, I created various ML models to predict credit card fraud. 

- First EDA is performed on the data to identify any coorelation between input variables and the target variable so that we could find patterns fo a customer churn.
- Balancing the chrun and non-chrun data in the csv file using SMOTE, ADASYN, Random Oversampling. 
- Creating models using Logictic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, XG Boost for each of the balancing techniques.
